NML.js
======

The Datadipity technology is configurable via a set of online forms. The tools enables you to integrate multiple API requests into a single JSON/XML endpoint. Once published, you can use these API endpoints in your applications and products.

Datadipity provides a simple yet powerful Javascript API for connecting and communicating with any type of API. Using the library we call NML.js you can instantly have user login, registration and api connectivity instantly in a single Javascript file. This Javascript can run in the browser or in the server and requires only the most well known depedency, JQuery.

The Javascript API is the core target for Datadipity development. Datadipity was built by front-end developers for front-end developers so more complex and fully integrated software products could be developed with simple tools such as HTML5 and Javascript. When using Javascript with Datadipity, software becomes highly scalable and very easy to maintain. The core functionality of an App built with Datadipity can reside in a single Javascript file and a single HTML file.
