NML.js
======

With the NML.js library, user login, registration, and API connectivity are deployed instantly using a single JavaScript file. NML.js is a simple HTTP client to automatically authenticate and connect to the developer portal, [Datadipity](https://datadipity.com). It is designed to work from either a web application or a Cordova hybrid mobile application. NML.js is dependent upon two popular frameworks, [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), it is extensible and can be used with many JavaScript / CSS frameworks.

Our developer portal, ([Datadipity](https://datadipity.com)) is a set of online forms. These forms allow integration of multiple API requests, in sequence or in parallel. These requests are converted into a single JSON/XML endpoint. You can use these API endpoints in your applications and products. These endpoints can be expressed as either private or public APIs.

NML.js provides a simple yet powerful JavaScript SDK for connecting and communicating with our developer portal ([Datadipity](https://datadipity.com)). The core functionality of an application built with Datadipity[LINK] is small enough to fit into a single JavaScript file and a single HTML file that work together.

The JavaScript SDK is the core target for [Nimblestack](https://nimblestack.io) development. Our process has been tested at more than 50 hackathons to develop a wide range of applications for a wide array of platforms. It is very easy for front-end developer to develop complex and fully integrated software products with simple tools such as HTML5 and JavaScript. When using JavaScript and our [developer portal](https://datadipity.com), software becomes highly scalable and very easy to maintain.
